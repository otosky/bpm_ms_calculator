# bpm_ms_calculator

A simple Python script to convert a **tempo** in beats-per-minute to **sub-divisions in milliseconds**.  

Useful for setting delay times and other rhythmic effects when you don't have access to tempo-quantization, like outside of a DAW.

### Motivation

When I got into making music with outboard gear, I found that I kept Googling bpm-to-ms charts any time I wanted to configure my delay units.  

This script is here to help spare you a Google search. :smile:
